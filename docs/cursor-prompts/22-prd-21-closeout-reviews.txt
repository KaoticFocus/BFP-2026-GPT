GOAL
Implement PRD 21: closeout status page, closeout checklist instance, handoff packet draft/publish (HTML->PDF export optional), review request drafts gated by CloseoutReady.

DO NOT
- Send review requests without CloseoutReady (unless owner override w/ reason)
- Auto-send messages; use Messaging Hub + approvals

FILES
- /packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma (Closeout, HandoffPacket, ReviewRequestDraft)
- /apps/api/src/routes/closeout.ts
- /apps/api/src/services/closeout/closeoutService.ts
- /packages/ai/src/prompts/handoff_packet_summary.v1.ts (optional)
- /packages/ai/src/prompts/review_request_draft.v1.ts (optional)
- /apps/web/app/(app)/app/[orgSlug]/projects/[projectId]/closeout/page.tsx

TESTS
- integration: CloseoutReady emitted only when punch list + required checklist items complete
- integration: review request draft can be created but sending requires approval

STOP CONDITION
Stop once closeout can be marked ready, a handoff packet can be generated, and review request drafts follow gating rules.
Print: "STOP — PRD 21 complete. Say 'continue' for E2E demo prompt."
