GOAL
Implement PRD 19: vendors/subs, RFQ draft->approval->send, quote upload/parse/review/accept -> commitments, bill capture -> actual cost.

DO NOT
- Turn procurement into ERP
- Auto-send RFQs without approvals

FILES
- /packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma (Vendor, Subcontractor, RFQ, Quote, VendorBill)
- /apps/api/src/routes/procurement.ts
- /apps/api/src/services/procurement/procurementService.ts
- /packages/ai/src/prompts/rfq_draft.v1.ts
- /apps/web/app/(app)/app/[orgSlug]/vendors/page.tsx
- /apps/web/app/(app)/app/[orgSlug]/projects/[projectId]/procurement/page.tsx

TESTS
- integration: quote accept emits CostCommitted and updates job cost summary
- integration: RFQ send requires approval

STOP CONDITION
Stop once quote acceptance creates commitments and vendor bill confirm posts actual costs.
Print: "STOP — PRD 19 complete. Say 'continue' for PRD 20."
