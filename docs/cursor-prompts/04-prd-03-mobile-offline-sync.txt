GOAL
Implement PRD 3: mobile offline queue for task completions, photo uploads, voice note captures. Sync push/pull endpoints.

DO NOT
- Require real-time connection for basic writes
- Lose data if the app is killed

FILES
- /apps/mobile/src/sync/queue.ts (SQLite-based queue: enqueue, dequeue, peek)
- /apps/mobile/src/sync/syncEngine.ts (push, pull, conflict resolution)
- /apps/api/src/routes/sync.ts (POST /v1/sync/push, GET /v1/sync/pull)
- /apps/api/src/routes/uploads.ts (presigned URL generation)
- /apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/tasks.tsx (optimistic UI with offline indicator)

TESTS
- integration: offline mutation syncs when online
- unit: queue persists across app restart

STOP CONDITION
Stop once task completion works offline and syncs correctly on reconnect.
Print: "STOP — PRD 3 complete. Say 'continue' for PRD 4."
