GOAL
Implement PRD 1: multi-tenant auth with device-code flow (for extension/companion), RBAC enforcement, audit trail tables.

DO NOT
- Auto-grant permissions
- Skip RBAC checks anywhere

FILES
- /packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma (User, Session, Org, Membership, DeviceCode, AIActionLog)
- /apps/api/src/plugins/auth.ts (JWT verification + session hydration)
- /apps/api/src/plugins/rbac.ts (permission checks)
- /apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts (device code, token exchange, logout)
- /apps/web/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
- /apps/web/app/(auth)/device/page.tsx (display code for companion)

TESTS
- integration: device-code flow issues token after user approval
- unit: RBAC blocks unauthorized role

STOP CONDITION
Stop once login works in web, device-code works in extension stub, RBAC middleware rejects unauthorized calls.
Print: "STOP — PRD 1 complete. Say 'continue' for PRD 2."
