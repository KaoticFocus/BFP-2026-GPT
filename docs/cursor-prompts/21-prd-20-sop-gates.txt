GOAL
Implement PRD 20: versioned SOP templates, gate status computation per project phase, stage-change warnings + override with reason.

DO NOT
- Hard-block stage changes in MVP (warn + override only)
- Hide override audit trail

FILES
- /packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma (SOPTemplate, ProjectGateStatus, StageOverride)
- /apps/api/src/routes/sops.ts
- /apps/api/src/services/gates/gatesService.ts
- /apps/web/app/(app)/app/[orgSlug]/projects/[projectId]/gates/page.tsx
- /apps/web/components/gates/GateStatusPanel.tsx

TESTS
- integration: contract signed + checklist completed improves gate status
- integration: stage change with red gate requires override reason recorded

STOP CONDITION
Stop once gates compute and stage change flow shows warnings and logs overrides.
Print: "STOP — PRD 20 complete. Say 'continue' for PRD 21."
